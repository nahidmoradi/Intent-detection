This code implements a chatbot system that includes three main parts: • Intent Detection • Vector Database for Information Storage and Retrieval • Chat System for response generation
1.	Intent Detection Intent detection means understanding the goal and purpose of the user's question. For this, the class IntentClassifier has been created. Structure of the IntentClassifier class: • The vectorizer uses CountVectorizer to convert text into numeric vectors. • The model is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model used for text classification. • The train function is responsible for training the model with training data.
Training the model and intent prediction: • Texts and corresponding intents are extracted from the training data and vectorized using CountVectorizer. • The SVM model is trained on the vectorized data. • The user's input is converted into a numeric vector, and the SVM model predicts the user's intent.
Example of training data:
training_data = [
    {"text": "How do I set the financial period?", "intent": "Set financial period"},
    {"text": "How do I configure system settings?", "intent": "General settings"},
    {"text": "How are account codes defined?", "intent": "Define account codes"},
    {"text": "Tell me about Amazon company.", "intent": "Company introduction"},
    {"text": "What software systems are included in Amazon?", "intent": " Amazon products introduction"},
]
This data teaches the model how to recognize the user's intent.
2.	Vector Database for Information Storage and Retrieval A vector database allows us to store and search information based on semantic similarity. In this code, Chroma is used.
VectorDatabase class for managing vector data: • OpenAIEmbeddings are used to generate text vectors. • Text data is stored using Chroma. • The retrieve function is used to fetch documents related to a specific query. • These documents are stored in the database and retrieved when needed.
Example of stored data in the vector database:
documents = [
    Document(page_content="The financial period settings are as follows..."),
    Document(page_content="General system settings include..."),
    Document(page_content="Account codes should be defined as..."),
    Document(page_content=" Amazon company provides financial and accounting software..."),
    Document(page_content=" Amazon's software includes accounting, payroll, production, and..."),
]
3.	Chat System and Conversation Management The chat model uses OpenAI (or an alternative model like Ollama) to generate responses.
ChatSystem class for managing conversation: • The GPT-4 model is used to generate responses, and the temperature is set to 0.7 to make the responses more creative. • This function uses the chat model to generate responses.
Summary:
• Intent Detection Model: Predicts the user's query intent.
• Vector Database: Used for storing and retrieving textual information.
• Chat System: Generates intelligent responses.
This chatbot can be used in customer support systems, automated response systems, and knowledge management software.
